# cpp-introduction
 This so-called introduction to C++ is based on a program that reads a word (as in an item) and it counts it for your list. It allows you to READ the LIST, INSERT in the LIST and REMOVE from the LIST.  All of this, in order to escalate and achieve a perfect CRUD with no database connections with this lenguage.
